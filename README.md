# SwiftPractice

This repository is a few dozen snippets of code and small projects of mine. Together, they're meant to act as a reference and a source of reusable code in the future.

Some of the projects are expanded clones of one another, and they vary in their complexity. 

Please look through for anything you might like, and feel free to use anything that you find fun, cool, or helpful.

Cheers!
